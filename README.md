# NYC-Taxi-Data-Engineering-Project

## Overview
This project involves extracting NYC taxi data from an API and storing it in a data lake. The data is transformed using the medallion architecture in Databricks with PySpark, progressing through bronze, silver, and gold layers. Delta tables are created in Azure Data Lake Storage (ADLS) and integrated with Power BI for dynamic visualizations.
